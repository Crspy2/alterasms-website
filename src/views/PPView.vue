                    We do not automatically record any data that your browser sends us when you first load up 
                    our website. However, once you make a purchase, we record the following information your 
                    browser sends us: your device's IP address, browser type and version and operating system 
                    type and version. This information is kept during your purchase to authenticate your 
                    payment and help our anti-fraud systems prevent malicious payments. After your payment 
                    is completed, our payment manager (Sellix.io) will store your information in case of a 
                    chargeback.

                    name, address, email address, credit card information, or other Personal Information. They 
                    each have a strict privacy policy that describes their collection and use of personal
